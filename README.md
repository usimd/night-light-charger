# Night light battery charger

One of our children's night light is battery-operated and does not feature a charging port but requires to open a battery enclosure and charge the batteries with an external charger.

This repo contains a small PCB project that adds a USB-C port for charging the three AA NiMH batteries using the [BQ25172](https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/bq25172) charging IC. The charge current is adjustable using a potentiometer (up to the max. 800mA) and a dual color LED will indicate if the device is currently charging (red) and once charging has finished (green).

The PCB is fitted into the case of this ANSMANN device (https://shop.ansmann.de/en/cartoon-nachtlicht-maus).

This project has been prototyped at [AISLER](https://aisler.net/p/OOQHJCJK).
